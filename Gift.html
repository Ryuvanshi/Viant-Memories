  <p class="flower-meaning">Blue Hydrangea â€” I remember that blue hydrangeas are your favorite calm, gentle, and quietly beautiful, just like you. Even if I canâ€™t give you the real thing, I wanted to send you this a small piece of peace and sincerity.</p>

      <div class="hidden-message" id="hiddenMessage">
        <p>Just like this flower, youâ€™ve brought calm and color into my world.
You might not realize it, but every little thing you do makes life feel softer, warmer, and a little more meaningful.
Iâ€™m truly grateful for every smile, every moment, and every memory youâ€™ve shared with me.
If my presence ever made things heavy, Iâ€™m sorry, it was never my intention.
All I ever wanted was for you to feel the peace and warmth youâ€™ve given me.
Thank you, truly, for being you the kindest person Iâ€™ve ever met.</p>
